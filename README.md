# change_color

You can change your display's color!
this is my firstApp made by flutter.

# how to use

if you push "DISPLAY" button, the screen gets black.
Because default is R:255 G:255 B:255.

if you push "TEMPLATE" button, you can choose color display on the screen.
if you want other colores, please comment in my GooglePlayStore page. 

if you push "SET COLOR" button, you set RGB value by bar or munual.
